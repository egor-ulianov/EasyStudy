Central to the tour's visuals were the Drones, which flew autonomously above the stage and across the audience, alongside giant projections which interacted with the band members on stage. This spectacle, featuring LEDs and lasers perfectly complimented the band's celebrated repertoire. Key songs performed on the tour included \"Psycho\", \"Madness\", \"Uprising\", \"Plug in Baby\", \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and Knights of Cydonia.\" Filmed and recorded over multiple shows the concert movie includes never before seen special effects along with an exclusive insight from the band in the introduction.",

By introducing researchers from diverse backgrounds for the first time, then dropping them into new, immersive field work they previously hadn't tackled, the film reveals the true potential of interdisciplinary collaboration, pushing the boundaries of how science storytelling is approached. What emerges is a deeply human trip to the foundations of discovery and a powerful reminder that the unanswered questions are the most crucial ones to pose. Directed by Emmy-nominated and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Ian Cheney (The Search for General Tso, The City Dark) and advised by world-renowned filmmaker Werner Herzog (Fitzcarraldo, Aguirre, The Wrath of God, Grizzly Man), The Most Unknown is an ambitious look at a side of science never before shown on screen.
